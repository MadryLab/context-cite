        "question":"What is hypophosphatasia (HPP)?",
        "answer":"HPP is a rare disease that occurs when the body isn't able to create enough normally functioning ALP enzyme to process the phosphate that it needs to make strong bones. In HPP, this leads to development of weak or \u201csoft\u201d bones. Soft bones can cause skeletal deformities, early tooth loss, dental pain, or other related symptoms. Even though HPP is a disease of bone mineralization, it can affect many systems throughout the body and impact overall health as well. HPP is also a chronic disease, so it will likely not go away on its own; therefore, HPP may have a profound effect on performing daily activities.",
