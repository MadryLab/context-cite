        "question": "What is alkaline phosphatase (ALP)?",
        "answer": "ALP is an enzyme that is essential for the process of building strong bones and teeth. People with hypophosphatasia (HPP) have persistently low ALP, which often explains the frequent bone fractures, tooth loss, and chronic pain that may be experienced throughout their lives.",

        "question": "What is hypophosphatasia (HPP)?",
        "answer": "HPP is a rare disease that occurs when the body isn't able to create enough normally functioning ALP enzyme to process the phosphate that it needs to make strong bones. In HPP, this leads to development of weak or \u201csoft\u201d bones. Soft bones can cause skeletal deformities, early tooth loss, dental pain, or other related symptoms. Even though HPP is a disease of bone mineralization, it can affect many systems throughout the body and impact overall health as well. HPP is also a chronic disease, so it will likely not go away on its own; therefore, HPP may have a profound effect on performing daily activities.",

        "question": "Is hypophosphatasia (HPP) a disability?",
        "answer": "In some cases, HPP can be disabling. Depending on your symptoms and where you live, you may be entitled to support, allowances, a disability pension, or other assistance.",

    {
        "question": "What types of medications could be harmful for someone with hypophosphatasia (HPP)?",
        "answer": "You should talk to your doctor and pharmacist before starting or stopping any medication. Additionally, some medications given to treat common misdiagnoses, such as osteoporosis, can cause HPP to worsen. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to get an accurate diagnosis early.",

    {
        "question": "Who can be diagnosed with hypophosphatasia (HPP)?",
        "answer": "HPP is a rare but inherited condition, which means that multiple members of the same family could have it. But it\u2019s important to know that anybody at any age can have HPP\u2014from in utero to adulthood.",

        "question": "Should I seek genetic testing for hypophosphatasia (HPP)?",
        "answer": "Whether you seek genetic testing for HPP is up to you and your doctor. It\u2019s important to note that genetic testing is not required to confirm an HPP diagnosis but may be a helpful resource. It could be beneficial to talk to your doctor, which may inform your decision to pursue genetic testing.",

    {
        "question": "How do you test for alkaline phosphatase (ALP)?",
        "answer": "ALP levels are measured with a standard blood test called a comprehensive blood panel. And it\u2019s important to adjust for age and sex in order to produce an accurate reference range, especially in children.",

        "question": "What are some common misdiagnoses and diseases that can look like hypophosphatasia (HPP)?",
        "answer": "Several conditions share symptoms with HPP, leading to common misdiagnoses from healthcare providers (HCPs). HCPs may initially look for common diseases over rare ones, or for conditions within their specialty. These are some diagnoses people with HPP may receive before getting their correct HPP diagnosis: Bones: Nutritional rickets, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, osteopenia/osteoporosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, osteomalacia Joints: Osteoarthritis/arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, pseudogout (gout without urate crystal formation) Teeth: Gum disease, dentinogenesis imperfecta",

    {
        "question": "How is hypophosphatasia (HPP) managed?",
        "answer": "Management options for HPP exist. Please reach out to your healthcare provider to learn more. Supportive management is also important. This can include physical therapy, treatment for broken bones as they occur, regular dental monitoring, and follow-up care for any complications.",

    {
        "question": "How would a healthcare provider diagnose hypophosphatasia (HPP)?",
        "answer": "The key to a correct diagnosis is hiding in plain sight. A review of a standard blood test called a comprehensive blood panel could be the answer to an HPP diagnosis: Persistently low age- and sex-adjusted ALP + at least one HPP symptom may be enough for a doctor to diagnose HPP, even in kids. A doctor should rule out all other causes of low ALP, and a diagnosis should always be made by a qualified healthcare professional.

        "question": "What specialists can help with hypophosphatasia (HPP)?",
        "answer": "Multiple doctors may be involved in the journey to an HPP diagnosis. For older children or adults, these may include a primary care provider, orthopedist, endocrinologist, rheumatologist, and geneticist. Additional doctors who may play a role in diagnosing infants or young children include a pediatric endocrinologist, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, a neonatologist, or a pediatrician.

        "question": "What are the symptoms of hypophosphatasia (HPP)?",
        "answer": "The symptoms of HPP may vary from mild to severe and may present differently based on age of onset. Symptoms can also change within the same person over time. HPP can affect bones and teeth, but there are other perplexing symptoms of this metabolic bone disease that form a larger picture of HPP. Some symptoms of HPP may include: Skull and Brain Premature closure of skull bones, leading to abnormally shaped head* Anxiety and depression Seizures* Headaches Fatigue Teeth Early tooth loss with the root intact Receding gums Lungs Improper development of ribs and chest deformities* Difficulty breathing and breathing complications Increased risk of pneumonia Kidneys Calcium buildup in the kidneys Kidney failure Skeleton Rickets Chronic bone pain Frequent or slow-healing fractures Weak bones or bowed legs Joints and Muscles Weakness Pain Arthritis Gout-like symptoms Muscle fatigue Missed motor milestones Mobility issues that may require an assistive device *Symptoms commonly seen in infants and young children.

        "question": "What\u2019s the significance of persistently low alkaline phosphatase (ALP)?",
        "answer": "ALP is an enzyme in the body that is crucial for the development of strong, healthy bones. When a person has persistently low ALP, this can contribute to many of the symptoms people with hypophosphatasia (HPP) experience, including frequent bone injuries and premature tooth loss. It is important for your healthcare provider to observe ALP levels over time, as persistently low ALP may be a sign of HPP.",
